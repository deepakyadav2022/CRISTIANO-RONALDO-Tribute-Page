            <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985 in Funchal, Madeira), better known as
                Cristiano Ronaldo, or by his nickname 'CR7', is a Portuguese footballer.
            </p>

            <p>
                He plays for Serie A club Juventus and the Portuguese national team. He is widely considered to be one
                of
                the
                greatest footballers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest ever.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ronaldo was once the most expensive professional football player of all time, after moving from
                Manchester
                United to Real Madrid for approximately £80m. At his presentation a Real Madrid player, 80,000 people
                greeted him at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. This is the wo record, breaking the 25-year record of
                75,000
                people at Diego Maradona's presentation for Napoli.
            </p>

            <p>
                He is the first player to win the UEFA Champions League five times. He also holds the record for the
                most
                number of goals scored in Real Madrid's history. Until this day, he remains the only player in the
                history
                of La Liga to score 30 or more goals in six consecutive seasons.

            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <p>
                Ronaldo is able to play on both wings and also as a striker since he is very strong with both feet, even
                though he is naturally right footed. He is also one of the world fastest players.
            </p>

            <p>
                He has good heading ability because he is over 6 feet tall and jumps high. He is also known for his free
                kicks; he likes to use the "knuckleball" technique, which is where the ball spins very little and
                creates an unpredictable motion.
            </p>

            <p>
                He combines this with his high shot power, making it hard for goalkeepers to stop his shots.

                performance
